# Customer-Analytics
To analyze data and identify marketing strategies, we employ the STP marketing approach. By using machine learning (ML) clustering analysis, we first divide all of our customers into segments or clusters. Additionally, we'll forecast the three most crucial customer behaviors:
1. Will consumers purchase a product?
2. What brands will they purchase?
3. How many will they purchase?

STP marketing model (Segmentation, Targeting, Positioning) is a familiar strategic approach in modern marketing. It is one of the most commonly applied marketing models in practice, with marketing leaders crediting it for efficient, streamlined communications practice.

STP marketing focuses on commercial effectiveness, selecting the most valuable segments for a business and then developing a marketing mix and product positioning strategy for each segment.
